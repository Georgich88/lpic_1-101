Перед выполнением заданий важно самостоятельно повторить шаги, выполняемые на уроке.

1) Find out which OS bootloader is used on your system
$ sudo file -s /dev/sda

2) View the kernel event log.
# dmesg

3) Change boot order.

  First, make a backup copy of /etc/default/grub. In case something goes wrong, you can easily revert to the known-good copy:

    sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak
  Then edit the file using vim or the text editor of your choice:

    sudo vim /etc/default/grub
  Find the line that contains

    GRUB_DEFAULT=0
  and set it to

    GRUB_DEFAULT=x
  where x is the index of grub menu item to which you would like to boot to by default. Note that the menu items are zero-indexed. That means that the first item in the list is 0 and that the sixth item is actually 5. So to boot to the sixth item in the list, the line would read:

    GRUB_DEFAULT=5
  If you forgot the order of the items, take a look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Each menu entry is specified by a line of type:

    menuentry 'Ubuntu' [options] {
  You can also chose the default by the name instead of index, e.g.:

    GRUB_DEFAULT='Ubuntu'
  if there was a menuentry 'Ubuntu' line on /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This may be a better method, as it does not depend on the order of the entries, which could change.

  To use a kernel in the "Previous Linux Versions" sub-menu use:

    GRUB_DEFAULT="Previous Linux Versions>x"
  (make sure to include the quotations), where x is the index of the old kernel on the sub-menu, or the name of the kernel as it appears in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. For example,

    GRUB_DEFAULT="Previous Linux Versions>4.13.0-43-generic"
  Then build the updated grub menu:

    sudo update-grub

4) Load Linux in a mode other than the default mode.

5) Find out the  init system Linux
  rpm -qf /sbin/init
